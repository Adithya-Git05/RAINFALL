Rainfall Prediction using Linear Regression
This project uses Linear Regression to predict rainfall levels based on historical data. The goal is to build a simple machine learning model that fits a line through the data and allows us to visualize and interpret the relationship between input features and rainfall.

Features
Trains a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Visualizes:

The training data

The regression line

The predicted value on the plot

Highlights prediction errors and the difference from actual values

Libraries Used
numpy

matplotlib

sklearn.linear_model

How to Run
Install dependencies

python rainfall_prediction.py
A graph will appear showing:

Training data points

Fitted regression line

Predicted value vs actual value

Error in prediction

Output
Graphical representation of the model's fit

Printed predicted value

Error magnitude (absolute difference from actual)

Example Output (Console)

Edit
Predicted value: 45.27
Actual value: 42.00
Error in prediction: 3.27
Notes
You can replace the dataset in the script with real rainfall data.

The script currently uses placeholder arrays for training data; update it with .csv data or your own inputs for better accuracy.
